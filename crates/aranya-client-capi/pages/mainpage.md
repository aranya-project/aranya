# Aranya C API

The Aranya C API allows a C application to interface directly with the
Aranya client using a library and header file.

Before attempting to use this API, verify that you're using a matching version of the C library, Aranya client header file, Rust example application, and getting started documentation.

1. Navigate to the [Aranya releases](https://github.com/aranya-project/aranya/releases) page.
2. Identify the [Aranya release](https://github.com/aranya-project/aranya/releases) matching this version of the C API documentation.
3. Checkout the [aranya](https://github.com/aranya-project/aranya/tree/main) repository at the commit matching that release or download the source code from the release and extract it onto your machine.
4. Refer to the top-level [README.md](https://github.com/aranya-project/aranya/blob/main/README.md) for instructions on running the [C example](https://github.com/aranya-project/aranya/blob/main/examples/c/README.md).
