Grepped for `-i cipher`, `-i crypto`, `'\bfs\b'`, `'\bnet\b'`, `'\bunsafe\b'`
and there were no hits except for one `unsafe`.

The lambda where `unsafe` is used is never invoked (e.g. the `unsafe` code
never runs) and is only introduced for some compile-time checks.  Additional
unsafe review comments can be found in https://crrev.com/c/5353376.

This crate has been added to Chromium in https://crrev.com/c/3736562.  The CL
description contains a link to a document with an additional security review.

I grepped for \"crypt\", \"cipher\", \"fs\", \"net\" - there were no hits.

All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in
the unsafe review CL at https://crrev.com/c/5350386.
