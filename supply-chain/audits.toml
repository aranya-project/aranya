It's segmented well so only the code for the platform being compiled for gets added, as well as it's easy to track down how exactly a piece of information is getting gathered. This does use a lot of unsafe for the above reason of needing to make a bunch of system API calls, some of which are calling into other languages like Objective-C, but I didn't see anything obviously malicious or incorrect."
